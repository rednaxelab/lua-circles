## Instructions for running this

Here's how you run this.

First you need to install love engine (which has Lua enging in it).

`brew install love`

That should install Love 2d engine and Lua JIT.

Now in order to run a game from command line with Love 2d engine, the console command is to take the `love` command and argument is the folder with your code (in this case `src`) as an argument.

Accordingly, to run this simulation and play with it, do:

`love src`

Then you can left click to add one circle, or right click to add 5. And on and on...

# lua-circles
